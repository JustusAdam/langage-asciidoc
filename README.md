# [Deprecated] Asciidoc language support

This extension is deprecated in favor of the more feature complete [AsciiDoc extension by Jo√£o Pinto](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joaompinto.asciidoctor-vscode).

Alternatively, if you really like this extension and don't want to switch you can take over maintenance. Contact me on github or twitter @justusadam_



Adds highlighting to AsciiDoc(tor) documents.
